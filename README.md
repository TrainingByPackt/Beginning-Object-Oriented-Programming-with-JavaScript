# Beginning Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript
This course begins with a subtle refresher on objects. It teaches you how easy it is to define objects with the new ECMAScript classes. From there, we'll fly you through some essential OOP principles, forming a base for you to get hands-on with encapsulation. You’ll get to work with the diffrent methods of inheritance. From there, we’ll move on to some advanced patterns for object creation, and you’ll get a strong idea of how to use interesting patterns to present data to users and to bind data. You’ll manage dynamic typing using various data types and get familiar with duck typing and polymorphism. You’ll explore various presentations such as MVC and MVP, along with implementing data binding. By the end of this course, you’ll discover whether JavaScript is asynchronous and learn to write asynchronous code using callbacks and events.


## What you will learn
* Master JavaScript's OOP features, including the ones provided by ECMAScript 2015 specification
* Learn popular Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns to build robust apps
* Learn inheritance and create mixins
* Implement object-oriented concepts in a wide range of frontend architectures
* Explore duck typing, an enhanced technique that allows us to define contracts between 
objects interacting with each other
* Manage asynchronous code in JavaScript
* Complete a variety of hands-on activities to help embed your newly acquired skills
